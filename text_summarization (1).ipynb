They exploited a vulnerability within Windows systems initially discovered by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). This vulnerability, which affected older Windows versions, had been made public by another hacker collective called the Shadow Brokers in April 2016, just a month after Microsoft released patches to address it. However, the impact of WannaCry was most keenly felt by organizations that had failed to implement these crucial security updates or were operating on outdated Windows systems beyond their supported lifespan. On May 12, 2017, the WannaCry ransomware spread rapidly, infecting over 200,000 computers across 150 countries. The consequences were dire, particularly for critical sectors such as healthcare, government agencies, and businesses, where data encryption led to significant operational disruptions. Financial losses resulting from the attack ranged from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, depending on the extent of the infection and its impact on individual organizations. Notable victims included major corporations like FedEx, Honda, Nissan, and even the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which struggled to maintain essential services amidst the chaos.\n"

        "#text = \"\"\"The architects behind the WannaCry attack were identified as a cyber group believed to be associated with North Korea, known as The Lazarus Group. They exploited a vulnerability within Windows systems initially discovered by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). This vulnerability, which affected older Windows versions, had been made public by another hacker collective called the Shadow Brokers in April 2016, just a month after Microsoft released patches to address it. However, the impact of WannaCry was most keenly felt by organizations that had failed to implement these crucial security updates or were operating on outdated Windows systems beyond their supported lifespan.\n",

        "#On May 12, 2017, the WannaCry ransomware spread rapidly, infecting over 200,000 computers across 150 countries. The consequences were dire, particularly for critical sectors such as healthcare, government agencies, and businesses, where data encryption led to significant operational disruptions. Financial losses resulting from the attack ranged from hundreds of millions to billions of dollars, depending on the extent of the infection and its impact on individual organizations. Notable victims included major corporations like FedEx, Honda, Nissan, and even the UK's National Health Service (NHS), which struggled to maintain essential services amidst the chaos.\n",
